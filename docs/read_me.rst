Welcome to the 2020 Q3 Data Collection â€“ Gross of Reinsurance view  Upload Assistant.

You should be the user(s) whom compiles the data for the regularly scheduled Global Portfolio Monitoring (GPM) data request. 

GPM thanks you for your work in providing Global Travel Leadership this vital reporting. We value your time and effort. 
	This application is meant to:
		1) provide you resources to make this process as simple and transparent as it can be,
		2) maximize the impact of your efforts,
		3) and identify process or technology limitations that impede gathering relevant data.

Depending on several factors we expect that gathering and preparing this data may take several work days or more.


Please launch the application with the "Upload Assistant Shortcuts.vbs" or the main application named "Upload Assistant.exe" in the "dist" folder.

If the application launches, start by reading the instructions privded on the instructions page. If you have trouble opening the application or are lost at any point contact GPM at
