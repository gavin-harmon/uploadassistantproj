<p>The Upload Assistant.</p>
<p>Custom data software I built and put into production in 2019. This is a dummy version of it, meant to test validations. Everything in these screen shots contain altered data meant to obfuscate any nominal figure or ratio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a very special use case. I had a mandate to improve unreliable reporting coming from more than 20 countries with a small team. Data collection became my sole responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An initial report of the input as loaded. This "Pandastable" interface is exportable and can even be used to do pivots and graphing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 26 highly custom validation screens that only pop up if there is an issue in the submission. Note&nbsp; this calls out USD as a not valis currency, everything here is dummy data proof of functionality. This software was in production for 24 months during my tenor as the an owner, sole developer, and administrator.</p>
